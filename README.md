# GloomyMon

Does your super bright multi-monitor setup melt your eyeballs while gaming or watching youtube videos? Well, if it does this simple app can help. It will draw a click-troughable and adjustable semi-transparent overlay on your secondary monitors. Thus reducing the brightness without the need to manually adjust the monitors.
